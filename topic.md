# 8: Collection of Underground App Distribution URLs on Telegram

## Description:
Due to Telegram's anonymity and convenience, many underground apps related to pornography, gambling, and financial fraud take advantage of the platform for distribution. 

## Task:

1）Channel Discovery:
- By using channel recommendation websites and bots, you can search for keywords like gambling or pornography to find lists of underground channels and groups.
- Bot website: https://telegramchannels.me/zh/bots
- Group sharing website: https://tgstat.ru/en/tags/geo

2）URL Extraction:
- Use scripts to crawl chat records from these channels and extract URLs.

3）Download Page Identification:
- Use scripts to visit the collected URLs and determine whether they are app download pages (keywords like iOS, Android, download, etc.)
- The number of valid URLs collected should be at least 200.

4）Report:
- Write a report about your experiments, encountered issues, and findings.(The list of channels and the final list of download URLs should be included.)
